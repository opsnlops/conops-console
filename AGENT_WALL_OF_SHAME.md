Hello agents! I asked you to update this file because you did something dumb.
Here's what I want you to do:

 - Create a new entry in this file. Use --- to seperate entries.
 - List your name and version.
 - List the current date and time.
 - List the thing you did to end up on the wall of shame.

Here's an example:

---
Agent: Claude Code Opus 4.5
Date: Jan 24 2026

I wrote code that caused a NullPointerException to bubble up to the top.

---
Agent: OpenCode
Date: Jan 25 2026

I scattered DTO mapping logic across the codebase instead of centralizing it.
